## Description

This course will not teach you SQL or programming languages, however, it will teach you skillsets and patterns that you can apply in database engineering. A few of the things that you will learn are Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding, Replication, b-trees in-depth indexing, Concurrency control, database engines and security, and much more.

I believe that learning the fundamentals of database engineering will equip you with the necessary means to tackle difficult and challenging problems yourself. I always compare engineering to math, you never memorize specific formulas and equations, you know the basic proves and derive and solve any equation one throws at you. Database engineering is similar, you can't possibly say MongoDB is better than MySQL or Postgres is better than Oracle. Instead, you learn your use case and by understanding how each database platform does its own trade-offs you will be able to make optimal decisions.  

One other thing you will learn in this course is the lowest database interface that talks to the OS which is the database engine. Database engines or storage engines or sometimes even called embedded databases is a software library that a database management software uses to store data on disk and do CRUD (create update delete) Embedded means move everything in one software no network client-server. In this video course, I want to go through the few popular database engines, explain the differences between them, and finally, I want to spin up a database and change its engine and show the different features of each engine.  

Enjoy the course.
